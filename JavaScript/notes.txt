Flex : In CSS we can control the sizing, alignment and positioning of elements within a container regardless of the forder in which they are in the HTML document.  For this we need the help of flex containers and flex items as its two main parts. 

Flex containers are created by changing an element's display peroperties to flex. The container used as the parent element for the flex items and transforms into a flexible box or flex container.  A flex containers direct child elements are transformed into flex items.

HTML will not perform,

	writing business logic

	custom validations

	event-based programming

To implement all those, we need the help of javascript. 

JavaScript is a scripting language, that which allows you to perform dynamic operations on the given page. 

To start with javascript, using 

<script>
</script> : By default script tag takes javascript as default language. 

You can define code in javascript by using functions.

as 

function function_name() {
...
...
...
}

in javascript, we have predefined events as 

onload() -> This event fires automatically once the page gets loaded. 

onclick() -> This event fires automatically once you click on the button.

onchange() -> This event fires automatically once you change checkbox/dropdown

alert() : Used to display any value or message 

In javascript, we can define variables by using var keyword.
